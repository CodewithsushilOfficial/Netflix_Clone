# Netflix HomePage 

This project is a clone of the Netflix homepage, created using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It aims to replicate the look and feel of the original Netflix homepage, providing users with a familiar browsing experience.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Netflix Homepage Clone project! ðŸŽ¬

Have you ever wanted to recreate the magic of the Netflix browsing experience right in your browser? Well, you've come to the right place!
As a fan of Netflix's user interface, I decided to recreate their homepage to hone my frontend development skills. This project allowed me to practice HTML structure, CSS styling, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.
